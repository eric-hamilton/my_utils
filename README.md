# My Utilities
This is a collection of some commandline tools for windows that I made and use fairly regularly.

### Find
A tool that works faster than the windows explorer to find filenames in a folder structure.

### Hasher
A utility to walk through a folder and print out the hashes of the files within. I use it to find duplicate files that have different names or filetypes.

### Launcher
A simple app launcher.

### Move
A utility to move all files of a given type from subfolders to a single location. I've found this helpful in organizing my VFX assets folders.

### Peek
A commandline tool to browse passwords securely.
I don't really use this anymore

### Search
A file-centric version of "Find." Allows the user to search through a file for a specific line. I use this to search within large manifest text files.

### Copy Path
Copy filepath to the clipboard with arguments for slash formatting. I use this with a right-click context menu.

### Empty
A tool to delete subfolders within a directory that are empty. Rather dangerous.
